## Problem

Although there are many resources for learning about Celeste speedrunning, each presents its own set of problems.

Most tutorials come in the form of YouTube videos, and over time become outdated. For these videos, even if the creator is still active, updating them to include modern strats is a significant enough undertaking that it can only happen every so often, if at all. Getting a good idea of what to do in a run can involve watching multiple tutorials, checking cue collections, cross-referencing with multiple runs, and so on. When going through the entire game, going through all these resources section by section can be a lot, and easily lead to missing information.

For those looking for reference material for a specific room or strat, if one of these tutorial/reference sources doesnâ€™t have the information, the solution often involves scrolling through endless unrelated search results in #strats and hopefully finding the specific thing you are looking for, or more likely, asking in #speedrun_help.

## Goals

The goals of this project are:

1. To create a [repository of strats](https://github.com/celeste-library/celeste-speedrun-data) that:
   1. Contains as many strats as possible for each room
   1. Covers as much detail as possible for each strat
   1. Have been verified by knowledgeable individuals
   1. Is easily searchable
   1. Contains metadata that allows it to be used in a variety of ways
   1. Can be exported and used by other projects
1. To create a [website](https://github.com/celeste-library/celeste-speedrun-library) that:
   1. Is a tutorial for users at a variety of skill levels and goal times
   1. Is a reference for users looking for information about any given room/strat
   1. Is easy and painless to use and navigate

These two sub-projects are connected; the website will use the strat repository on the backend.
